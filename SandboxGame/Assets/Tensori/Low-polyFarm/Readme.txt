Thank you for your purchase! You can take a look at the assets in the example scene found in 
YourProject/Assets/Tensori/Low-polyFarm/Scenes/ExampleSceneRaceTrack

(If the assets glow in pink, check section 2. below!)

You can use the free flying camera in play mode to inspect the scene. The controls are W,A,S,D
or arrow keys to move, and holding right mouse button to look around. Depending on the Unity
version and/or render pipeline you can accelerate by left shift or left mouse button.

1. Under Your Project/Assets/Tensori/Low-poly Farm/Prefabs you can find the game ready prefabs
with LODs that you can just drag in to your scene. (Note that some of the prefabs are scaled
differently in the example scene)

2. How to set up shaders for materials in different render pipelines (assets glowing in pink):

- You can either manually choose your preferred shaders for each material, or
- Import the correct materials from YourProject/Assets/Tensori/Low-polyFarm/MaterialPacks
  by right clicking in project hierarchy and choosing "Import package -> Custom package"
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Additional lighting settings in the example scene for Built-in & HDRP render pipelines:

- with the Built-in render pipeline, in the scene hierarchy you can choose Lighting -> DirectionalLight
  and bump up the light intensity in the inspector to about 1.2 for a better lighting
  
- similirary with the HDRP render pipeline, in the scene hierarchy you can choose Lighting -> DirectionalLight
  and change the light intensity in the inspector to about 2000 Lux (under the Emission tab)
